<p>

<li>The right to object to us using your personal data for a specific purpose or purposes.</li>

<li>The right to data portability. This means that, if you have provided personal data to us directly, we are using it with your consent or for the performance of a contract, and that data is processed using automated means, you can ask us for a copy of that personal data to re-use with another service or business in many cases.</li>

</ol>
